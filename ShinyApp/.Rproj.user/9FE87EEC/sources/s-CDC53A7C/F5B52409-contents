### Documentation for Shiny app for Developing Data Products Course Project

This shiny app shows a K-means analysis for the mtcars dataset. The user can specify the x and y axis for the k-means analysis. However, only the numerical columns from the mtcars dataset is included, because k-means can only be run on numerical data. 

The user can specify the number of clusters, with a minimum of 1 and maximum of 9 clusters. 

The plot should update as soon as a new x column, y column, or number of clusters is selected by the user.
